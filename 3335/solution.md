problem is simple enough, you loop over the input string, char by char, get char code, increment, if it is 'z' then replace with 'ab'.

repeat until t transformations.

this is the solution i came up with:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthAfterTransformations(string s, int t) {
      int transformations = t;
      std::string currString = s;

      while (transformations > 0) {
        for (char& c: currString) {
          if (c != 'z') {
            if (c + 1 == 'z') {
              c = '0';
            } else {
              c += 1;
            }
          }
        }

        int pos = 0;
        bool zReplaced = false;
        while ((pos = currString.find('z', pos)) != std::string::npos) {
          currString.replace(pos, 1, "ab");
          zReplaced = true;
          pos += 2;
        }

        cout << currString;
        cout << "\n";
         --transformations;

        std::replace(currString.begin(), currString.end(), '0', 'z');
      }

      const long long MOD = 1000000007;
      return currString.length() % MOD;
    }
};
```

although the approach itself is straightforward but this is highly unoptimal

the size of currString keeps increasing with every iteration since replace happens in place.

so i put the code in chat gpt, let it figure out the better solution.

the approach chatgpt suggested uses a frequency map, the frequency map keeps track of occurence, increments it 

==

start by creating a freq map (or rather arr in this case of size 26). this is the current state of the frequency map

start by looping over all chars & storing their occurences in the freq map

then until t > 0 start a while loop

in the while loop, we create a new map of size 26

now loop over integers 0-24 since we dont need to increment z (or do anything else with it YET), and update the next frequency by incrementing count of next index by its nextFreq value + value of the index in freq arr

i visualise this as simply right shifting over the frequency array by 1 (and we dont worry about z since that will be used to increment a & b)

0 1 2 3 0 2 0 _ ...
  0 1 2 3 0 2 0 ...

this right shift successfully implements the second part of the logic: increment character by 1 like a -> b, b -> c

after this step, we need to get the occurence of all z & add it to the nextFreq[0] (which is freq of 'a') & nextFreq[1] (which is freq of 'b')

mod is performed at all calculations to keep the numbers as small as possible and keep memory footprint low

post this, freq is set to nextFreq and the while loop can continue once again


perform a sum of all elements in the freq arr to get total length of the string
